                               limited partnerships. Our primary strategy is development and re-development of
                               retail shopping centers, value-add properties, public storage and market-rate
                               apartment rentals.

                               management team from real estate and capital raising sectors. We seek to fund
                               various limited partnerships in key markets through equity financing and deploying
                               capital into best-of-class projects, via new or existing construction that will

                               goal of maximum results, otherwise known as success. At WCM, we believe in
                               the simplicity of the supply and demand strategy, thus embracing the top 10 US
                               markets as our initial phase to leverage the highest ROI potential. These markets
                               are currently withstanding a low supply and high demand condition. WCM will
                               facilitate by supplying multi-family, retail, mixed-use and storage development
                               throughout the most demanded regions within each market.

                               Typically, investments in real estate projects tend to be high. WCM seeks to brighten
                               that paradigm by sponsoring limited partnerships that will make it possible for investors
                               to participate in such opportunities while leveraging maximum returns with a much lower
                               investment level than the current industry standard. Given the state of the global economy,
                               we believe that developing alternate investment methods in real estate is the best strategy
                               for both maintaining and growing wealth.

                               opportunity for investors to get to know the sponsors and general partners of every
                               project personally. Take pride in building relationships.

                               pooling capital through fractionalized ownership. There’s a unique opportunity
                               for investors to participate in residential and commercial real estate projects
                               that would present challenges if done individually.

                               Limited partnerships are not a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes.
                               Instead, the tax benefits incurred by the partnership pass directly through to the
                               investors.  Current tax laws allow for pass-through depreciation of the property and
                               interest payments on mortgages or directly to investors as a passive income or loss.

                               WCM aims to produce an average annual 30% internal rate of return (IRR) to investors
                               within the limited partnerships. This average is far greater than potential annual
                               returns of traditional investments such as stocks, bonds, CD’s, etc…It is time to

                               <span class="wcm_subsub_ttl_II">What are real estate limited partnerships?</span> <br>
                               A real estate limited partnership (LP) is an investment vehicle that optimizes
                               returns through the selling and/or leasing of properties. Investors are able to
                               enjoy the benefits of a direct investment in tangible assets without many of the
                               complexities that normally accompany such investments. Limited partnerships not
                               only offer higher returns than traditional real estate investment trusts (REITs)
                               but greater tax benefits as well. As a real estate limited partnership shareholder,
                               you own a portion of a company that is solely structured for the purpose of developing
                               a particular property.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                               The ventures sponsored by Wheat Capital Management, LLC. (WCM) are generally formed
                               as limited partnerships.  The partnerships’ sponsors pool investment funds to develop
                               projects and/or to re-develop existing properties. The general partner, who, in the
                               case of a limited partnership is known as a sponsor, is responsible for operating and
                               sustaining the company’s assets. Limited partners, which are the investors of the LPs,
                               are not liable for losses beyond their original investment and do not participate in
                               the partnership management.

                               <span class="wcm_subsub_ttl_II">What is a Private Placement?</span> <br>
                               A private placement is a type of investment offering that is exempt from registration
                               with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Public companies must register
                               with the SEC, which can be expensive and time consuming. Typically, real estate projects
                               are structured as LPs and capitalized through a Private Placement Memorandum (PPM).
                               Such PPMs still undergo standard due diligence but present an opportunity to save time
                               and money for all parties involved.

                               WCM has identified the top markets in the U.S. that present a high demand and low supply
                               of both commercial and residential real estate. We work with key developers that build
                               best-in-class properties. Typically, such developers need additional equity financing to
                               complete a project. This is where WCM comes in – we can facilitate the analysis, acquisition,
                               financing and exit strategy of select projects. Our business model is centered by experienced
                               in-house associates and world-renowned partners, enabling higher returns for our investors.

                               Our sponsored limited partnerships carry a 2-5 year cycle, though time may vary due
                               to the market’s characteristics. Real estate is cyclical in nature and times may vary
                               to achieve the most favorable investment positions. Every project is unique; our
                               goal is to always exit a project as soon as possible, optimizing a return on investment
                               and profit for all.

                               Rea estate LPs are not suitable for all investors.  WCM presently works only with
